const PROBLEMS = [
  "Five different logo versions in circulation, none of them usable at small sizes.",
  "A homepage that opened with a company history instead of what the business actually does.",
  "Quote requests buried three clicks deep, behind a form nobody could complete on a phone.",
  "Service pages written for the owner, not for the person searching at 9pm with a problem.",
];

const STEPS = [
  {
    icon: Compass,
    title: "01 — Diagnose",
    body: "I started with the same 5-minute audit I offer free: walk the site as a first-time visitor on a phone, note every point of friction, and rank them by how much revenue they touch. Messaging and mobile quote flow came out on top; the logo was third.",
  },
  {
    icon: PenTool,
    title: "02 — Rebuild the brand basics",
    body: "One logo system with proper small-size and single-colour variants, a two-typeface pairing, and a tight colour set with real contrast rules. Enough of a system to stay consistent, not so much that nobody follows it.",
  },
  {
    icon: LayoutGrid,
    title: "03 — Rewrite before redesign",
    body: "The homepage now leads with what the business does, who it does it for and where. Each service page answers the question that brings people there, then makes the next step obvious. Layout was designed around that copy, not the other way round.",
  },
  {
    icon: Smartphone,
    title: "04 — Mobile-first build",
    body: "Designed at 360px first and scaled up. A short quote form above the fold, tap-to-call in the header, and no interstitial that hides the primary action on small screens.",
  },
  {
    icon: Rocket,
    title: "05 — Launch and hand over",
    body: "Shipped on a modern no-code / AI-assisted stack with forms, analytics and SEO basics wired up, plus a walkthrough so the owner can update copy without calling me.",
  },
];

const OUTCOMES = [
  {
    title: "One consistent brand",
    body: "Site, invoices, truck decals and social profiles finally use the same mark, type and colours.",
  },
  {
    title: "A quote request that works on a phone",
    body: "The primary action is visible on the first screen on mobile, and completing it takes seconds rather than a scroll hunt.",
  },
  {
    title: "Pages that answer a search",
    body: "Each service has its own page with its own title, description and clear intent — so it can be found and shared on its own.",
  },
  {
    title: "An owner who can maintain it",
    body: "Copy edits, new services and new photos no longer require a developer.",
