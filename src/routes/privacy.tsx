          <UL>
            <li>
              Information you give us: your name, email address, phone number, business name, and

          <P>
            We do not sell your information. We share it only with service providers who help us
            operate — our CRM and scheduling platform, our payment processor, and our email and
            hosting providers — and only so they can perform that service for us. We also disclose
            information where the law requires it.

            Our site uses cookies and analytics to understand how pages are used. You can block

          <H>Keeping and deleting information</H>
          <P>
            We keep information for as long as we are working together and for as long afterwards
            as we need it for tax, legal, and record-keeping purposes. You may ask us to delete
            your information at any time by emailing {L.email}, and we will do so unless we are
            required to keep it.
          </P>

          <H>Your choices</H>
          <P>
            You can ask us what we hold about you, ask for it to be corrected or deleted,
            unsubscribe from email at the bottom of any email, and stop text messages by replying
            STOP.
